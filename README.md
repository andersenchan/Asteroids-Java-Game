# Asteroids-Java-Game

A side-scroller game where the player shoots oncoming asteroids to gain points! This was my first coding project, which I made during the winter break of my junior year.

Features:
- multiple sizes and speeds of asteroids
- as the game progresses, the total number of asteroids on screen constantly increases

Features to Implement:
- larger asteroids should break with two missile hits and smaller asteroids should break with only one missile hit
- implement multiple bullets since only one bullet can be fired at a single time
- menus: a main menu with a difficulty selection, and a final high score table with a new game button
- the inclusion of an end boss
- sound effects and background music
